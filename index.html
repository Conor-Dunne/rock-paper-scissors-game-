<!--
1. Create function to return random answer from computer
2. create function to accept selction from user and computer
3. compare inputs and declare win, lose , or draw.
4. Make play function to perform a 5 round game and report overall winner


Play function

* set two variables to record player/computer score if they win a round
* Use a for loop to call playRound 5 times
* update player or user score with 1 point if they win
* stop after five rounds and compare scores
* declare winner with the highest score
